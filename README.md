# Cache-Memory-Simulator
The goal of this project is to design, model, and implement an interactive and educative 
program for simulating the functionality of cache memory.
This application can be used by those who are trying to understand the way data is 
written in the cache memory or read from the cache memory. Such an application can bring 
a more accessible approach to a topic that could be confusing when starting to learn about 
layers of computer memory.
